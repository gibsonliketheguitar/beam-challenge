Comments.
- Learned about Material UI. (Nice for creating internal tool, might bring it to 100% to improve Material UI skill)
- Challenge is ridiculous for take home, but I got it 75% way there.
- Recieved no feedback and comment after all the effort. Never again will I do these type of take homes

Notes about implementation
1. Material UI primary component library
2. Jotai used for state management
3. Hand implmeneted table View, would probably use react-table for future integration
4. Form validation integrates Material UI and React Hook Form. 

In order to test and load roster data.
download the CSVs located here https://github.com/gibsonliketheguitar/beam-challenge/tree/main/src/store
  1. once CSV has missing column and will through error
  2. another should be proper CSV data
