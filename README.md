Comments.
- Learned about Material UI. (Nice for creating internal tool)
- Challenge is ridiculous for take home, but I got it 75% way there. Maybe will bring it to 100% responsive, and match styling
- Recieved no feedback and comment after all the effort. Never again will I do these type of take homes
